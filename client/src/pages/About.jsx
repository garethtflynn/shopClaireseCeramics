            I'm Ashlynn Landry, a 20-something-year-old building a career for myself in Web Development. Born in Baton Rouge, raised as a Georgia peach, and graduated with a BBA from Ole Miss, my heart lies in many places, primarily with my dog Jamie, pottery, and design.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 font-light italic text-black">
            In my previous role as Marketing and Communications Coordinator at Good Samaritan Health Center, I grew a liking for web design and development, which led me to the Georgia Institute of Technology's coding Bootcamp. I am working towards a Full Stack Flex Web Development certificate and will graduate in December 2022.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 font-light italic text-black">
            With my background in marketing and a love for graphic design, this website showcases the skills I have learned thus far in web development as well as in ceramics.
